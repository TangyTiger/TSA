This makes me really dissapointed as I spent much of my childhood in this park, and seeing it like this causes me great sadness. So, in an effort to clean up the park, I would hope you all join me in a beach cleanup on April 1st, at 4:00 and Soccer Field 3 to do a cleanup of the park we know and love.",

First, all donations would be helpful and grealty contribute to the success of this project, and then, on June 15th, I hope all of you will join me in planting trees at 11 AM at the parking lot. ",
